# Designing a conscious machine

We are going to start this argument from the position and with the direction that Descartes proposed in his Discourse on the Method: that of doubting everything we have held true up till this moment, with the aim of finding something that can be taken as indubitably true, that we can use as the foundation for a universally acceptably rigorous Science. Descartes argued that understanding the sentence "I think, therefore I exist" makes it indubitably true (which is fully convincing). Then he said that this truth can be used as a first principle for Science. And this was disputed, essentially on the grounds that, even if "I think", "A therefore B", and "I exist", are sentences that are commonly unambiguously well understood as units of meaning, their internal structure is not - the difference and the relation between the possible meanings of "I" and of "think" and of "exist" is very unclear. Which is also fully convincing.

A way to get out of this impasse is to take one meta-step: from seeing the truth of "I think, therefore I am", we go into seeing the truth of "the sentence 'I think, therefore I am' is true"; and then, obviously, into seeing the immediate truth of "there is a true sentence"; "there is language". And we know quite well what is language, what structures we need to have language.

Descartes defines "thought" as "what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it, insofar as I am conscious of it". This is not exactly what is usually understood as thought nowadays, when thinking is usually understood to imply some kind of rationalization. So let's rename this original cartesian concept of "thought" instead as "SPE" (subjective present experience) to avoid confusion.

The essential argument in Descartes relies on the coincidence between the understanding of the sentence "I think" (the realization of its relationship with its meaning, thus making it a sentence, making it language) and its meaning, coincidence that is given because understanding the sentence is *thought* - something that "happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it"; and it is this coincidence provides the indubitability of its truth. The translation of "I think" to our new terminology would be "there is SPE", and since the understanding of that sentence is itself SPE, its truth is, again, immediate.

And now we can get more out of this SPE concept. First, as seen, we can say, without the shadow of a doubt, that "there is SPE". And second, we can say, without a doubt, that "SPE has enough structure to support language".

So let's briefly review what kind of structure we need to support language. We want to be able to have a sentence (or a set of sentences, from now on if I say "a sentence", also assume "or a set of sentences"), that is well constructed (valid), has a meaning, and has a truth value.

Let's start with a valid and true sentence, such as "there is SPE". We want SPE to contain its syntactic structure. We can easily account for that, in several ways. We can contain the shape of the sequence of letters in our present subjective visual experience, or in our imagination. Or we can have the memory of the sequence of sounds needed to utter the sentence. Then we need a meaning for the sentence. This can be any sort of structure that may be present in SPE. Even the actual presence of SPE, as is the case with our example. And then we need to compare both structures and see that they coincide, which is something we can do with basically any 2 parts of SPE.

With a false sentence, we would have that we can imagine a meaning for the sentence, but it does not coincide with the intended meaning; with an invalid sentence, we would have that we cannot even imagine a meaning for the sentence.

Now let's examine what can we say about the structure of SPE, in so far as it allows us to understand language.

The 1st thing we can say about SPE is that it comes in units of people. "I" is the common name for the here and now SPE, the one that is essential for the whole argument we are making (the one in which the understanding of the sentence "there is SPE" and its meaning coincide). We can also assume that there are more units of SPE, more people, without yet assuming anything about any space which we may share and in which we may communicate. At this point, we can extend Descartes definition of SPE prescribing that SPE is that which is immediately available to me and is not available to any other person.

Now, the most basic aspect of the internal structure of SPE is change; so there is time, an absolute, newtonian time, which we can call subjective time ST. We say it is absolute because it allows a single timeline. Zenon of Elea showed that this time cannot be an interval of the reals or the rationals, so we must assume a discrete sequence of instants. There are a huge number of ways in which the SPE can change in any given moment. So we can describe a space SSPE with one dimension for each of the ways in which SPE moments can change; in this scenario, we can call a point in this space an instant of SPE.

There is nothing infinite in our present experience, so we must assume the SSPE has a finite number of dimensions, each of which is finite in itself. It seems most probable that the SSPE of each person has its own set of dimensions.

With this, we might think of a curve from ST to SSPE, providing a succession of instants of subjective experience. But let's keep in mind that we are still in the position of doubting everything that has not yet been revealed as indubitable to us; and the descriptions of memories of past experiences are certainly and unacceptably doubtful. Memories are SPE, but their descriptions are not indubitable, and even saying that memories correspond to past moments of experience can be doubted. There is, however, the fact that I experience change, and time, immediately: change is part of SPE. So a moment of SPE cannot be just provided by a single point in SSPE, but by some succession of them. It is in this sense that we may think of a curve from ST (as a succession of instants comprising the present moment) into SSPE - though, as is clear, and addressed below, this does not yet provide a sufficient (to support language) or accurate description of SPE.

Let's now start a digression, in which we take a leap of faith and trust our memories, and then we find a new concept of time, one that is not subjective but consensual, which we call physical time PT. Change as observed in this consensual time can be explained fully and exquisitely using the language of physics. So along with investigating the structure of SPE, we will try to provide a physical explanation for it. This is akin to designing a SPE machine. We start designing it with the objective of providing for SPE as a curve from ST to SSPE, even though we already know that such is not an accurate description of SPE; but it is a useful exercise.

Starting with time, we must note that PT is not newtonian, but lorentzian (each trajectory has its own timeline), so we cannot equate it with ST. Therefore our machine needs to produce an artificial, synchronic time. This means having some kind of clock ticking, and some observable observed at each tick of the clock. Just like a computer, in which the observable is the state of the screen or the speakers, whose state is governed by the internal clock. The difference with the example of a computer is that the state in our machine must include more than one state at each tick of the clock, to account for the experience of change, but of course we can simulate this with a computer, e.g. having several screens showing delayed frames. We can postulate something similar in the brain.

Now addressing SSPE, we can account for it with the neural structure of our nervous systems. Each dimension in SSPE can correspond with e.g. the rate of excitations of some neuron, or with the concentration of some solvent in some synaptic gap, or something of the sort. For example, a dimension corresponding to the shade experienced in some point of the visual field might correspond to the excitations of some neuron in the retina, or perhaps in the visual cortex. So we have a huge host of observables scattered all over the brain that take part in the SPE machine, which we may call neural determinants of the SPE.

Then our machine needs to do 2 things, in this order: gather all observables into a single complex observable, and transform that single observable into SPE. It cannot be the other way round; if we first convert each observable into a local particle of experience, we will still need some way of combining all the particles of experience into a single unified discrete experience, into a person; and then we will be as well saying that it is this unification that really transforms the particular observables into SPE.

So our machine needs to gather the signals from all neural determinants of SPE, combine all those signals into a single signal, and then do something with that signal to take it into the SPE. An analogy would be each instrument in the concert hall producing a sound that is then combined by the acoustics of the hall into a single symphony, to do something with it like enjoy it. And, regarding the brain, it is not difficult to imagine a network of neurons gathering the signals from the neural determinants of SPE into a single central neural determinant.

There is one thing to note though: since we are centralizing and thus de-localizing the individual signals, we will need to enhance each of them with information about its origin. Otherwise there would be no way of distinguishing e.g. 2 different points in the visual field.

As said, we still do not have enough structure to account for language in SPE. In language we have several different sets (one for the sentence, one for the meaning, one for the comparison), each with a different structure, and those structures have to fit in a very specific and precise way. But what we have so far regarding SPE are just sets of points in SSPE without any further structure. So let's see what further structure can we find within SSPE.

Let's note that ST is ordered, and therefore has a natural topology; and also that the changes that happen in SPE are very clearly subjectively continuous. So we must be able to find a topology in SSPE - easily, since all its dimensions are ordered. But there is not only the product topology from the topology of each of the dimensions as totally ordered sets; there is also a topology on the set of dimensions, which is immediately apparent in the actual SPE, in which I do not experience disconnected atomic information units, but sets of those as units of experience, basically what Pierce called qualia. This provides SSPE with a very rich topology.

So at this point we have that my SPE can be satisfactorily described as a function, from my present ST into the space of subsets of the topology of SSPE. Each point in this space is a set of open sets of values in the dimensions of SSPE. This certainly provides enough infrastructure to have language. It actually provides a crazy amount of infrastructure.

And now we see a problem trying to replicate this structure within the brain. We need to enrich the signal from each atomic neural determinant of SPE with information about the open sets in which it takes part. And this is more information that fits the brain, and this is an understatement. We have then to conclude that we cannot use the language of Physics to describe a SPE machine.

The solution to this problem is to turn the tables, and use the structure of SPE as the basis for the language of Physics.
